A terminal based arcade game in Python3 heavily inspired by Jetpack Joyride (without using any external libraries other than numpy and colorama)

## Introduction:
Din is a mandalorian living in the post-empire era. He is one of the last remaining members of his clan
in the galaxy and is currently on a mission for the Guild. He needs to rescue The Child, who strikingly
resembles Master Yoda, a legendary Jedi grandmaster. But there are lots of enemies and obstacles in
his way, trying to prevent Din from saving Baby Yoda. Din is wearing classic mandalorian armour and
has a jetpack as well as a blaster with unlimited bullets. Youâ€™ve got to help him fight his way through
and rescue Baby Yoda.


The objective of the game is to collect as many coins as possible, fight the obstacles on the way, defeat
the boss enemy and rescue Baby Yoda.
